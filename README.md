## About <a name = "about"></a>

Node-Docker-Prune is a Node.js app designed to automate the process of pruning unused docker images by running the "docker image prune -a" command periodically. This app is particularly useful for managing game servers, web applications, or any service that requires periodic pruning of docker images to ensure optimal performance.

</br>

## Installing <a name="installing"></a>

To install Node-Docker-Prune, clone the Git repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YoloFTW/Node-Docker-Prune.git

cd Node-Docker-Prune

npm install
```

</br>


## Configuration <a name="Configuration"></a>

To configure Node-Docker-Prune edit the .env file with the correct time and discord webhook url.

The default time is set at 00:00:00 each day.

You can also edit the "TITLE" variable to change how the module is reflected in the webhook message.

Node-Docker-Prune will also need elevated privilages to run. This can be acomplished either by running as sudo **NOT RECOMENDED** or by running the app as a user with access to docker commands.

</br>

This can be done with:

```bash
sudo adduser newuser
```

</br>

The new user then can be added to the docker group with:

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker newuser
```

</br>


## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To start Node-Docker-Prune, run the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

</br>

If you want to use the new user whilst logged into a different acoount, this can be acomplished with:

```bash
sudo -u newuser node index.js
```


Once configured and started, Node-Docker-Prune will handle the automatic pruning of unused docker images as per the defined schedule. It will also send status updates to the specified Discord webhook after each restart.
